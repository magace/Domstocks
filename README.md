## **📌 What Does It Do?**
Domstocks is a **Kolbot inventory management tool** designed to help you:

✔️ **Manage item stocks** for all realms  
✔️ **Edit multiple items at once** with bulk actions  
✔️ **Sort & search** through your inventory with ease  
✔️ **Automatically track stock changes** adds and removes items from pickit automatically  
✔️ **Sync with existing Kolbot data** with minimum modification (based off restrucutre branch)

## **📌 Roadmap**

Planned features for future updates:

~~🔹 Dropper – Drop selected items directly from the app~~

## **📌 Final Notes & Bugs**

THIS IS FOR D2LOD NOT D2R!!!


Unidentified Jewels were returing wrong pickit line on d2r have not tested with d2lod.

Since I will be adding webedit in the future I decided to add Authentication to the app.  Please reach out to me if you want to use this.  Regards.
