## **📌 What Does It Do?**
Domstocks is a **Kolbot inventory management tool** designed to help you:

✔️ **Manage item stocks** for all realms  
✔️ **Edit multiple items at once** with bulk actions  
✔️ **Sort & search** through your inventory with ease  
✔️ **Automatically track stock changes** adds and removes items from pickit automatically  
✔️ **Sync with existing Kolbot data** with minimum modification (based off restrucutre branch)

## **📌 Roadmap**

Planned features for future updates:

🔹 Dropper – Drop selected items directly from the app

🔹 Discord – Send specific notifications to discord channels

🔹 Automule – Auto detects mule profiles and mf profiles to setup config from the app

🔹 Webedit - Edit everything from a webpage so you can easily view stocks, edit items, add items and more


## **📌 Bugs**

THIS IS FOR D2LOD NOT D2R!!!

Since I will be adding webedit in the future I decided to add Authentication to the app.  Please reach out to me if you want to use this.  Regards.
