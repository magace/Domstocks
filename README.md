## **📌 What Does It Do?**
Domstocks is a **Kolbot inventory management tool** designed to help you:

✔️ **Manage item stocks** for all realms  
✔️ **Edit multiple items at once** with bulk actions  
✔️ **Sort & search** through your inventory with ease  
✔️ **Automatically track stock changes** adds and removes items from pickit automatically  
✔️ **Sync with existing Kolbot data** with minimum modification (based off restrucutre branch)

## **📌 Roadmap**

Planned features for future updates:

~~🔹 Dropper – Drop selected items directly from the app~~

~~🔹 Discord – Send specific notifications to discord channels~~

~~🔹 Autoperm – Keeps characters with stock perm~~

🔹 Automule – Auto detects mule profiles and mf profiles to setup config from the app

🔹 Webedit - Edit everything from a webpage so you can easily view stocks, edit items, add items and more


## **📌 Bugs**
Plenty im sure.  I just needed to get something going asap.  Please reach out with any you find. :)

## **📌 Final Notes & Bugs**

THIS IS FOR D2LOD NOT D2R!!!
